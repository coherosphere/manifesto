# coherosphere / manifesto

**The coherosphere is the sphere of coherence — where humanity, technology, and values align.**

This repository contains the **coherosphere manifesto**:  
a living declaration that defines the moral and philosophical foundation  
of a decentralized civilization in resonance with life.  

It is both a **vision and a vow** — a call to transform fragmentation into coherence,  
competition into contribution, and technology into meaning.

## Purpose

The manifesto establishes the **ethical and ontological roots** of the coherosphere.  
It frames the transition from disconnection to alignment, outlining a path toward  
systems that are self-steering, transparent, and grounded in shared human purpose.

It serves as:
- a **moral constitution** for the coherosphere community,  
- a **north star** for governance, AI, and economics,  
- and a **philosophical seed** from which the Whitepaper and Architecture evolve.

## Contents

- **Foundational Principles** — coherence, alignment, resonance, participation  
- **Declaration of Intent** — technology must serve life, not dominate it  
- **Cultural Ethos** — transparency, diversity, and shared meaning  
- **From Fragmentation to Coherence** — the human transition narrative  
- **Manifest as Code** — guiding architecture for Proof-of-Contribution systems  

The manifesto is not fixed — it evolves.
